2. Create your sw projects under [projects/](projects/) folder.
3. Check [.gitignore](.gitignore) file and modify it if it is necessary
4. Check the [./Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and extend it if necessary
5. Make sure that the whole project can be compiled with a single "make all" command.  
   also implement "make clean"
6. Fill out the [CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS) file. Here is the official github [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)

## Hardware requirements
** TODO ** List the required hw components.

## Hardware Setup
** TODO ** Create a block diagram about the components.

## Build environment setup
** TODO ** Add steps here how to create a build environment. Remove the not supported platforms.

### Docker
Using Docker for the build environment has several advantages:
- **Consistency**: Ensures the build environment is the same across all development machines.
- **Isolation**: Keeps the build environment isolated from the host machine, avoiding conflicts.
- **Portability**: Allows the build environment to be easily shared and reproduced.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies scaling the build process across multiple machines.

To set up the Docker-based build environment, follow these steps:
1. Install Docker on your machine. Only Linux and MacOS platforms are supported for now.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Build the Docker image using the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).
4. Run the Docker container with the necessary configurations.

### Windows
